Python is my favorite programming language because of how flexible it is! If you didn't already know, here is how to create a python function:
```
def writeCode:
    print("Hello World")
```

One of my favorite foods is rice! Here is how to make it:
1. measure out the rice
2. rinse it 3-4 times
3. add twice the amount of water
4. cook till all water has boiled off and rice is soft (but not mushy)
